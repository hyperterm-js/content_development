# findNeedles() API

## Overview <a name="Overview"/>


**findNeedles()** is a Java-based API that takes two strings, string *needles*, an array **up to 5 words**,
and string *haystack* as parameters, and searches for *needles* in *haystack*. **findNeedles()** will return each *needle* with its number of occurences in *haystack*.  

findNeedles() API example:
	
	String haystack = "Large amounts of rain expected tommorrow.";
	String[] needles = {"large", "amounts", "rain", "expected", "Friday"};
	findNeedles(haystack, needles);
	
Will return:
	
	large: 1
	amounts: 1
	rain: 1
	expected: 1
	Friday: 0


## Use case example<a name="Uses"/>

The following is an example of a **findNeedles()** use case:

- SEO keyword indexing:
	- Given a keyword list, we will call your *needles*, and your target files, the larger "haystack", 
	you can iterate over files and compare your list of *needles* using each 
	file (converted to a string) as a *haystack*. For each *needle*, count them and return 
	the result to see if your targets are using the list of keywords.

```java
    public static void findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles) {
       if (needles.length > 5) {
           System.err.println("Too many words!");
       } else {
           int[] countArray = new int[needles.length];
           for (int i = 0; i < needles.length; i++) {
               String[] words = haystack.split("[ \"\'\t\n\b\f\r]", 0);
               for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
                   if (words[j].compareTo(needles[i]) == 0) {
                       countArray[i]++;
                   }
               }
           }
           for (int j = 0; j < needles.length; j++) {
               System.out.println(needles[j] + ": " + countArray[j]);
           }
       }
   }
